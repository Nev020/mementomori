### I. Clarity

You do not need more time. You need to **value the time you have left**.

This is not software. This is a deliberate state of mind. We have taken the abstract concept of mortality and distilled it into a single, seamless, and inevitable experience.

It begins with your birth.

### II. Essentialism

Design is not simply how it looks, but how it works.

The **Life Clock** is powered by pure **JavaScript** date mathematics. It is live chronological computation—pure time difference, generated on demand. We removed everything that did not directly serve the core purpose.

* **The Progress Bar:** Visual feedback. The rhythm of your consumption. Nothing else.
* **The Interface:** Input your DOB and Expectancy. Press Initialize. Two inputs. One truth.

### III. Precision

We selected the units because they are true.

The goal is **Temporal Awareness**—to guide your focus toward present action. We quantify life's duration across three precise magnitudes for a multi-layered result.

| Scale | Unit | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hours** | Total remaining hours ($H$) | The vast, raw scale of opportunity and longevity. |
| **Minutes** | Total remaining minutes ($M$) | Focus on the immediate task and present week. |
| **Seconds** | Total remaining seconds ($S$) | The highest fidelity, constantly reminding you of movement. |

The **Percentage Consumed** ($P$) is calculated by:
$$P = \frac{(T_{now} - T_{birth})}{T_{expected\ death} - T_{birth}} \times 100$$
It is the point of optimal sustained attention to your life's progress.

### IV. The Human Element

1.  Enter your **Date of Birth**.
2.  Input your **Life Expectancy** (e.g., 80 years).
3.  Press Initialize.

**The most powerful technology is that which centers your attention.**

**This is Memento Mori.**
