## I. Clarity

You don't need more time. You need to **value the time you have left**.
This is not merely an application. This is a deliberate, moment-by-moment measurement of your finite existence. We have taken the abstract concept of mortality and distilled it into a single, seamless, and inevitable numeric countdown.

It begins with your birth.

## II. Essentialism

Design is not simply how it looks, but how it works.
Memento Mori is powered by native **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is live chronological mathematics—pure time difference, calculated and updated every second. We removed everything that didn't directly serve the core purpose.

* **The Numbers:** Direct display of remaining time in **Hours**, **Minutes**, and **Seconds**.
* **The Progress Bar:** Visual feedback. The rhythm of your consumption. Nothing else.
* **The Interface:** Input your DOB and Expectancy. Press Initialize. Two inputs. One truth.

## III. Precision

We selected the units because they are true.
The goal is **Temporal Awareness**—to convert years and decades into tangible, countable units. We display time based on three precise scales for three precise results.

| Scale | Calculation | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hours** | Total hours remaining until projected end. | The immense, raw scale of opportunity. |
| **Minutes** | Total minutes remaining until projected end. | Focus on the immediate task and the present. |
| **Seconds** | Total seconds remaining until projected end. | The highest fidelity, constantly reminding you of movement. |

The **Percentage Consumed** isn't accidental. It's the moment of optimal sustained attention to your life's progress.
